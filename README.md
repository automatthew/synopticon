# Synopticon

Sync DOM and CSS changes to a page between browsers using real time notifications.

Create a file named `.spire_secret`, then run this command:

    bin/synopticon -o bookmarklets.html

`bookmarklets.html` should now contain a simple web page with two bookmarklet links: one for the master session, and one for slave sessions.
